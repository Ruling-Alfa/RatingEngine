## Overview

RatingEngine is designed to provide a robust and efficient mechanism for calculating and managing ratings. Built with .NET, FastEndpoints, and Aspire, the project emphasizes performance and clean architectural patterns. The engine can be integrated into various applications where rating or scoring logic is required.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Utilizes FastEndpoints to deliver fast and efficient API responses.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clearly separated layers for domain services, infrastructure, persistence, and DTOs.
- **Extendable**: Easily adaptable to new rating algorithms or scoring methodologies.
- **Service Defaults**: Integrated with Aspire to standardize service configurations and defaults.

## Requirements

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (or later)
- Docker (if you plan to use the provided Dockerfile)
- A supported IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ruling-Alfa/RatingEngine.git
   cd RatingEngine
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies and Build**

   Use the .NET CLI to restore dependencies and build the solution:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Navigate to the project host directory and run:

   ```bash
   cd RatingEngine.AppHost
   dotnet run
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration settings (such as database connections or API settings) can be managed via the `appsettings.json` file located in the host project directory. Adjust the configurations according to your environment needs.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the rating engine API endpoints. Refer to the API documentation (if available) or review the code in the FastEndpoints controllers for specific routes and parameters.

For example, you might send a POST request to `/rate` with the necessary input data to receive a rating response.
